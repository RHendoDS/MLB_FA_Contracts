# MLB_FA_Contracts
For this project, I am attempting to predict MLB Free Agent Contracts from 2013-2023 using only the playersâ€™ stats leading up to the year they signed their contracts. To do this I will be using multiple different linear regression models. One model to predict the Average Annual Value (AAV) of the contract and one model to predict the length of the contract. I will repeat those two models for batters, starting pitchers and relief pitchers creating six models in total as each group has very different desired statistical goals.  This project includes web scraping, data munging, model evaluation, and visualization in R and uses regression modeling and feature selection in Python.
